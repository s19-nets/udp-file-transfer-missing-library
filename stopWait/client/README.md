# Stop and Wait - Client

This directory contains a simple program implementing a client that can
request specific files from a server.

# How to Use
To start the client, simply type the following command into the command line:
~~~

The program will prompt you to enter a file name. Enter a valid file name to
begin the transfer.

Files retrieved from the server will be stored in this directory.

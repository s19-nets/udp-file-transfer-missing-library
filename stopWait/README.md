# Stop and Wait

Within this directory is a simple implementation of a basic file transfer protocol.

This folder contains:
* A folder containing the client program.
* A folder containing the server program and "server-side" files.

## How to Use

1. Within the server folder, start the server program using the following command:
~~~
./server.py
~~~

2. Within the client folder, start the client using the following command:
~~~
./client.py
~~~

3. The client will prompt you to request a file. There are two files on the server:
~~~
foo.txt
story.txt
~~~
Entering either one will begin the transfer.

4. Once the transfer is finished, the program will terminate.
